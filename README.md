# Analyze Iris Data
The project is done by using the machine leearning algorithms
The libraries used are pandas,numpy and for Data visualisation Matplotlib and for modelling purpose Scikit-learn(sklearn).
the algorithms used to compare the best outcomes are 
1)Logistic Regression
2)Desicion Tree Classifier
3)K neighbour classifier
4)Linear Dterminant Analysis
5)Gaussian NB
6)SVM
As the data set used are of 3 different groups as per data its easy to classify other than finding error so accuracy is prioritised.
With LDA the accuracy is 100.
